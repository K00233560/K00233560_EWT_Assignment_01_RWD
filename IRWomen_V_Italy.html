                        Griffin leads from the front in Ireland win against Italy
                    </h1>

                            Captain Ciara Griffin crossed for a second-half double as Ireland's dominance eventually told in their Women's Six Nations victory over Italy at Donnybrook.

                            Megan Williams' early try had put the hosts in the lead but a combination of strong Italian defence and wasteful Irish attacking meant they only lead 7-3 as the hour mark came and went. Michela Sillari had notched a penalty in the first half for the visitors in one of their rare attacking forays but in the final quarter Ireland finally found their attacking form. And it was captain and No.8 Griffin who was twice the beneficiary from a dominant pack performance to score. Niamh Briggs converted all three scores before Italy's late consolation came in the form of an Eleonora Ricci score from close range.

                            After defeat to France in round one, Adam Griggs' Ireland are back on track - although they could not claim a four-try bonus point - while Italy are still chasing their first win of this year's Championship. Ireland have won the last three meetings between these two teams and it was they that started the brighter. Even a serious-looking injury to Alison Miller could not derail them in the early stages and it was Williams who went over for the game's first try inside ten minutes. The winger dotted down under the posts as their early pressure eventually told, good handling working the overlap down the right for the youngster.

                            The Irish scrum was totally dominant but they could not add to their tally as handling errors handed possession back to Italy time and again. Manuela Furlan then went close with a searing break from her own half before Valentina Ruzza was felled just short of the line and the hosts survived. Sillari did slot a penalty however just before the interval and Ireland lead 7-3 at the break.

                            The second half was largely one-way traffic, heroic Italian defending and carelessness in the opposition 22 from Ireland keeping the scores close. But their dominance up front eventually told after Sene Naoupu and a rolling maul went close, and it was skipper Griffin who showed some quick thinking to dot the ball down from within inches of the line. Briggs curled the extras over as well for a 14-3 lead and in the final ten minutes Ireland went chasing two more tries and a bonus point. Briggs was held up over the line soon after but from the subsequent five-metre scrum, Griffin kept the ball at her feet at the base of the scrum to drop down for her second score.  But it was Italy - downed at home by England last week - who had the final word when prop Ricci barged over from close range.
